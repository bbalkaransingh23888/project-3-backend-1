## Project Description

This finance tracker is a simple tool for users to visualize their spending history. 
The back-end will be built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. 
Our users value a minimal layout and functionality to achieve their goals faster.
Users will be able to make an account and sign in. 
Users will be able to store their expenses in a database, organized by date and category. 
Users will be able to exclusively access their own expenses. 
Users will be able to see their expenses as a table and as a chart.
In future features, users will be able to log in using social media accounts, select dates, and select different types of charts.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
